### 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

### DESCRIPTION

Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.
A linked list is a dynamic data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand. Any application which has to deal with an unknown number of objects will need to use a linked list.
NOTE: this is a version belonging to a personalized printf which does not contains the flag characters, precision, field widht and lenght modifiers.
