### Description



### Files

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]) | Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix |
| [1-print_binary.c]() | Function that prints the binary representation of a number. |


### General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

#Resources
## Read or watch:
* Sorting algorithm
* Big O notation
* Sorting algorithms animations
* 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. 
It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
